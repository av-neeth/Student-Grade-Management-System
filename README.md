## Demo

### Establishing a Basic Connection Using mysql.connector

Hereâ€™s a brief demo of how to establish a connection to your MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` module:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='your_password'  # Replace with your MySQL root password
)

# Check if the connection was successful
if conn.is_connected():
    print("Successfully connected to the database!")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to the database.")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```
